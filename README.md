# SEED — Sustainable Environmental Eradication of Debris

**Live:** [https://gurehmat.github.io/Millhacks-Website/](https://gurehmat.github.io/Millhacks-Website/)

## Overview

Single-page, public site for a MillHacks submission. It explains **SEED**, a concept to identify and remove coastal plastic pollution using **satellite spectral imagery**, **machine-learning prioritization**, and **drone-based collection**. Purpose: communicate the problem, approach, and contact details.

## Content

* **Why this matters** — impact of coastal plastic accumulation.
* **Spectral Imagery** — mapping high-risk coastlines from satellite data.
* **Machine Learning** — ranking hotspots and triaging cleanup routes.
* **Innovative Drones** — shoreline collection method and deployment notes.
* **Call to Action** — demo/video placeholder and contact information.

## Audience

* Hackathon judges and partners evaluating the concept.
* Students/collaborators needing a fast overview.
* Potential sponsors or stakeholders interested in pilots.

## Non-Goals

* No backend, data pipeline, or live satellite integrations.
* No operational drone control interface.
* No user accounts or form handling (static content only).

## Design / UX

* Mobile-first, responsive landing page.
* Section-based narrative with clear headings and CTAs.
* Skimmable layout for quick decision-making.

## Tech (high-level)

* Static stack: **HTML**, **CSS/SCSS**, **Vanilla JavaScript**.
* Hosted on **GitHub Pages**.

## Status & Next Steps

* Current: public info page for the SEED concept.
* Suggested next steps: link real demo video, add simple data visuals, optional contact form (EmailJS/Netlify Forms), and a short technical write-up of the ML pipeline and drone ops assumptions.
